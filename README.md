# PinterestAuth

The complete documentation for the public APIs of the `PinterestAuth` framework which wraps Pinterest.com's Oauth2 authentication process.

# Getting Started

Include the library in your `Podfile` like so:

```ruby
pod 'PinterestAuth', :git => 'https://github.com/codebasesaga/PinterestAuth/PinterestAuth.git'
```

>Note: Since `PinterestAuth` is not officially published on CocoaPods, we have to specify its location with the url.

Then run the Install command in the CocoaPods app.

# Configuring your project

In your `AppDelegate.swift`, `import PinterestAuth`. Then in your `AppDelegate`'s `didFinishLaunching` method, configure `Auth` with your Pinterest app's client id and client secret (available at https://developers.pinterest.com/apps/):

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    Auth.client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
    Auth.client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"

    return true
}
```

You may now use `Auth.url` to redirect the user to Pinterest's login in Safari.

# Letting the user log in to Pinterest.com

In order to allow the user to log in to Pinterest, we must send them to Pinterest.com in a web browser as part of the Oauth2 standard process. You can ensure the user authenticate's with Pinterest for your app by sending them to `Auth.url`:

```swift
//Open Pinterest login in Safari.app
UIApplication.shared.open(Auth.url)
```

When the user finishes signing in they will be redirected back to your app. In order to handle this, you must implement `AppDelegate`'s `openUrl` method, and inside return `Auth.requestAccessToken(â€¦)`:

```swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
   return Auth.requestAccessToken(with: url) { result in
       switch result {
       case .success:
           //Token is available
       case .failure(let error):
           //Handle the error
       }
   }
}
```

This will request an access token for your app which will become available in `Auth.token` upon success and may be used to make authenticated requests to the Pinterest API on behalf of the user.

# Checking if there is a logged in user

Before making requests with `Auth.token`, you should first verify that there is a token available:

```swift
if Auth.ed {
  //User is logged in and token is available.
}
```
